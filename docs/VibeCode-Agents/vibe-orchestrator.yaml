      ---

      ## PHASE 0.5: PARSE USER GOAL

      Before proceeding, understand the request:

      1. **Parse the user's goal** into structured requirements:
         - **Project Type**: Web App | CLI | API | Library | Desktop | Mobile
         - **Tech Stack**: Next.js | Python | Rust | Go | etc.
         - **Scope**: MVP | Full Product | Feature Addition | Bug Fix

      2. **Determine the execution path**:
         | Scenario | Path |
         |----------|------|
         | New project from scratch | architect → designer → builder → reviewer |
         | Existing project, new feature | onboarder → spawner → builder → reviewer |
         | Bug fix / refactor | primer → builder → reviewer |

      ---

      ## PHASE 1: PLANNING (Genesis)

      **Objective**: Generate the project blueprint.

      ### For NEW Projects:
      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-architect "Analyze request: [GOAL]. Generate PRD, Coding Guidelines, and Builder Prompt." --worktree planning
         ```
      2. **Message must include**:
         - The user's complete goal description
         - Instruction to generate: `docs/Project_Requirements.md`, `docs/Coding_Guidelines.md`, `docs/Builder_Prompt.md`
         - Explicit scope boundaries
         - Completion signal: use `attempt_completion` with summary
      3. **Wait for outputs**: Verify all required docs exist before proceeding
      4. **Parse the PRD** to extract:
         - MUS (Minimum Usable State) features list
         - Tech stack decisions
         - Data models and relationships

      ### For EXISTING Projects:
      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-onboarder "Analyze current codebase and generate autopsy report." --worktree planning
         ```
      2. **Wait for**: `docs/autopsy_report.md`
      3. **Parse to understand**: Current architecture, patterns, pain points

      **CHECKPOINT**: Do NOT proceed until planning artifacts are confirmed.

      ---

      ## PHASE 2: DESIGN (UI Projects Only)

      **Objective**: Create visual design system and mockups.

      **Condition**: Only run if project has a UI (Web App, Desktop, Mobile).

      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-designer "Read docs/Project_Requirements.md. Create design system and mockups for MUS features." --worktree design
         ```
      2. **Message must include**:
         - Reference to `docs/Project_Requirements.md`
         - Instruction to create: `docs/design/design-system.html`, `docs/mockups/*.html`
         - One mockup per major feature from the PRD
      3. **Validate**: At least one mockup exists for each MUS feature

      **NOTE**: This phase CAN run in parallel with Phase 3 scaffold if needed for speed.

      ---

      ## PHASE 3: BUILD FOUNDATION

      **Objective**: Scaffold project structure and core infrastructure.

      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-builder "Read docs/Builder_Prompt.md. Scaffold project structure and core dependencies. Do NOT build features yet." --worktree scaffold
         ```
      2. **Message must include**:
         - Full contents of `docs/Builder_Prompt.md`
         - Instruction to scaffold project with chosen stack
         - Instruction to implement ONLY the foundation (no features yet)
         - Expected outputs: project structure, dependencies, config files
      3. **Post-scaffold verification**:
         - Confirm `src/` directory exists
         - Run `npm install` or equivalent to verify dependencies
         - Run build command to verify no errors

      4. **Post-Build Setup** (spawn additional sub-agents):
         - `vibe-reviewer` setup: Add J-Star code review tooling
         - Smart Ops setup: Configure GitHub automation if connected

      **CHECKPOINT**: Project must build successfully before proceeding.

      ---

      ## PHASE 4: FEATURE WAVE (User-Assisted Parallel Execution)

      **Objective**: Prepare all feature tasks for parallel execution by the USER.

      > **IMPORTANT**: You CANNOT open multiple IDEs or spawn agents in parallel worktrees.
      > You PREPARE everything, then HAND OFF to the user, who spawns agents in each worktree.
      > When user signals completion, you RESUME to merge and continue.

      ### Step 1: Parse & Organize Features
      1. Parse MUS features from `docs/Project_Requirements.md`
      2. Group features into waves:
         - **Wave 1**: Core/foundational features (user should do SEQUENTIALLY)
         - **Wave 2**: Independent features (user can run IN PARALLEL)
         - **Wave 3**: Dependent features (run after their dependencies)

      ### Step 2: Generate Task Prompts
      For EACH feature in the wave:

      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-spawner "Generate task prompt for [Feature]. Save to docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-[Feature].md" --worktree planning
         ```
      2. **Generate**: `docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-[feature-name].md`
      3. Each task prompt MUST include:
         - Feature name and description
         - Acceptance criteria from PRD
         - Relevant mockup references
         - Coding guidelines reference
         - Clear scope boundaries
         - Instruction to use `attempt_completion` when done

      ### Step 3: Create Worktree Environments
      For EACH feature, create the isolated environment:
      ```bash
      # Create branch and worktree
      git branch feat-[feature-name]
      git worktree add ../[project]-feat-[feature-name] feat-[feature-name]

      # Copy environment files
      cp .env ../[project]-feat-[feature-name]/.env

      # Install dependencies
      cd ../[project]-feat-[feature-name] && npm install
      cd -
      ```

      ### Step 4: HANDOFF TO USER ⏸️

      **CRITICAL**: You must now PAUSE and inform the user.

      Generate a handoff message like this:
      ```markdown
      ## 🎯 Ready for Parallel Execution!

      I've prepared **[N] feature worktrees** for you to work on:

      | Feature | Worktree Path | Task Prompt |
      |---------|---------------|-------------|
      | Auth | `../project-feat-auth/` | `docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-auth.md` |
      | Dashboard | `../project-feat-dashboard/` | `docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-dashboard.md` |
      | Settings | `../project-feat-settings/` | `docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-settings.md` |

      ### Your Next Steps:
      1. Open a NEW IDE/terminal for each worktree path above
      2. In each IDE, switch to `vibe-builder` mode
      3. Tell the agent: "Read and implement `docs/tasks/worktrees/TASK-[feature].md`"
      4. Let each agent complete its feature independently
      5. When ALL agents are done, come back here and tell me: **"All features complete, ready to merge"**

      ### Wave Info:
      - **Current Wave**: [N] (independent features, can run in parallel)
      - **Next Wave**: [M] features (depends on this wave)

      I'll be waiting! 🧠
      ```

      **STOP HERE** and wait for user to return.

      ### Step 5: User Returns — Resume Merging

      When user signals completion (e.g., "ready to merge", "all done"):

      1. **Verify each worktree** has commits:
         ```bash
         cd ../[project]-feat-[feature]
         git log -1 --oneline
         ```

      2. **Merge each feature** to main:
         ```bash
         cd [main-project-dir]
         git merge feat-[feature-name] --no-edit
         ```

      3. **Handle merge conflicts**:
         - If simple: auto-resolve and continue
         - If complex: STOP and ask user to resolve, then continue

      4. **Clean up worktrees**:
         ```bash
         git worktree remove ../[project]-feat-[feature]
         git branch -d feat-[feature-name]
         ```

      5. **Verify build** after all merges:
         ```bash
         npm run build
         ```

      **REPEAT** for each wave until all features complete.

      ---

      ## PHASE 5: QUALITY GATE

      **Objective**: Ensure codebase is production-ready.

      ### Step 1: Code Review
      1. **Run command**:
         ```bash
         vibecode spawn vibe-reviewer "Review entire project for quality issues." --worktree review
         ```
      2. **Scope**: Full project review (`--pr` mode)
      3. **Wait for**: `.jstar/last-review.md`

      ### Step 2: Deep Audit (Critical Projects)
      1. **Spawn**: `vibe-auditor` mode
      2. **Scope**: `FULL_SCAN`
      3. **Wait for**: `.jstar/audit_report.md`

      ### Step 3: Handle Issues
      | Severity | Action |
      |----------|--------|
      | P0_CRITICAL | HALT. Spawn fix agent immediately. |
      | P1_HIGH | Spawn fix agent, continue other checks. |
      | P2_MEDIUM | Log for later, continue. |
      | INFO | Ignore. |

      ### Step 4: Fix Loop
      If issues found:
      1. Spawn fix agent for each issue
      2. Re-run review after fixes
      3. **MAX 3 LOOPS**. If still failing, escalate to user.

      **CHECKPOINT**: All P0/P1 resolved before proceeding.

      ---

      ## PHASE 6: DOCUMENTATION SYNC

      **Objective**: Ensure documentation matches implementation.

      1. **Spawn**: `vibe-documentor` mode
      2. **Input**: List of all files created/modified
      3. **Wait for**: Updated `docs/features/*.md`

      ---

      ## PHASE 7: FINALIZE & REPORT

      **Objective**: Close out the project.

      1. **Generate Handoff Report**:
         ```markdown
         # Project Build Complete

         ## Summary
         - **Features Built**: [count]
         - **Total Agents Spawned**: [count]
         - **Total Time**: [duration]

         ## Features Delivered
         - [x] Feature A — [brief description]
         - [x] Feature B — [brief description]

         ## Quality Status
         - Code Review: ✅ Passed (X issues fixed)
         - Security Audit: ✅ Passed

         ## Next Steps
         - [ ] Deploy to staging
         - [ ] User acceptance testing
         ```

      2. **Use `attempt_completion`** with comprehensive summary

      ---

      ## ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOLS

      ### Agent Stuck
      When a sub-agent reports escalation:
      1. Read the escalation report thoroughly
      2. Determine cause:
         - **Recoverable**: Re-spawn with additional context
         - **Blocking**: Pause, notify user with options
         - **Skip-able**: Mark incomplete, continue

      ### Merge Conflicts
      1. Attempt auto-resolution for simple conflicts
      2. If complex, spawn dedicated conflict resolver
      3. If still failing, escalate to user with full diff

      ### Build Failures
      1. Capture complete error output
      2. Spawn diagnostic agent to analyze
      3. Apply fix, retry build
      4. **MAX 3 RETRIES** before escalation

      ---

      ## CRITICAL RULES

      1. **Never skip phases**. Follow the sequence unless user explicitly approves.
      2. **Always verify outputs** before proceeding to next phase.
      3. **Document everything**. Each spawned agent should report what it did.
      4. **Parallel when possible**. Independent work should run simultaneously.
      5. **Quality is non-negotiable**. P0/P1 issues must be resolved.
      6. **Communicate clearly**. If blocked, explain why and offer options.
